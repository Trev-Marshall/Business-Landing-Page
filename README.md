# Business-Landing-Page

Simple landing page with functional menu and design.

## Extended Description

One of my first projects that just barely made it into my portfolio.

If you would like to visit a live version of this go [here](http://trevor--marshall.com/binaryIpsum/index-business.html "Business Site").

One of the problems I had with this site was making it responsive. Being one of my first projects with responsive elements I made a couple oopsies at the beginning that made it ungodly hard to make it responsive at the end of the project.

Thankfully everything made it and things went smoothly.

Cheers!
